# PictureDiscordBot

This is a bot for Discord that I made around a year and a half ago that I just decided to put on here because I thought it was kind of cool. 
If you send a message that begins with an exclamation point at the beginning, it will google image search whatever comes after the exclamation,
and send a random photo of the top three google results (or it could be five. I can't remember and don't care enough to look back at it).
It also uses a very simple machine learning thing to respond to queries that start with a dollar sign at the beginning although it's not as cool as it sounds.
It uses the machine learning to determine what response to use from a list of predetermined responses. If it doesn't know how to respond, it'll
ask how it should reply next time, and the user can input whatever they would like it to say next time someone asks a similar question, hence all the
profane things in the 'intents.json' file. While this feature did take the most time in the project, I tend to focus on it less because it works
significantly less well and it's less fun. The pictures is the most cool in my opinion and people seem to enjoy it more.
