# PictureDiscordBot

This is a bot for Discord that I made around a year and a half ago. If you send a message that begins with an exclamation point at the beginning, it will Google image search whatever comes after the exclamation and send a random photo of the top three Google results to the whole channel. It also uses a very simple machine learning program to respond to queries that start with a dollar sign at the beginning and to determine what response to use from a list of pre-determined responses. If it doesn't know how to respond, it will ask how it should reply next time, and the user can input whatever they would like it to say next time someone asks a similar question.
